# minoTour
Real time data analysis tools for the minION sequencing platform.

	The simplest way to use minoTour is to register for an account on our server in Nottingham. To do so, visit http://minotour.nottingham.ac.uk/register_new.php and create an account. Then contact Matt Loose (matt.loose@nottingham.ac.uk) to activate your account for data upload. You must include your user name with that email.

	The next easiest method would be to set up your own Amazon instance of minoTour using our preconfigured installation. Details of this will be provided here shortly.

	The most complex method is to configure your own server. Full details for this are provided in the accompanying PDF document. To download these files ensure that you have GIT configured on your target server. Create a directory and type:
	git clone https://github.com/mattloose/minoTour.git
