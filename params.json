{"name":"minoTour","tagline":"Real time data analysis tools for the Oxford Nanopore minION sequencing platform.","body":"### Welcome to minoTour.\r\nminoTour is a suite of web based tools that enable real time analysis of read files generated by the Oxford Nanopore minION sequencing device. This page provides additional information on the tools themselves. Full installation instructions for setting up your own minoTour server are contained in the PDF file in the repository itself.\r\n\r\nBy far the easiest way to use minoTour is with our Nottingham, UK, based server at <http://minotour.nottingham.ac.uk/>\r\nIf you wish to use our server you will need to register at <http://minotour.nottingham.ac.uk/register_new.php> and then email your user name to me (matt.loose(at)nottingham.ac.uk) to request that we activate your account for data submission). \r\n\r\nA video describing some of the features on minoTour is available here:\r\n<https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZRMMSsw7O4>\r\n\r\n### Installation and Configuration Instructions for your own minoTour server.\r\nWe provide an example for configuring an Ubuntu 14.04 server for minoTour. You should obviously modify these instructions as you need for your favour of UNIX. Instructions for configuring minoTour on the same computer as the minION device will be provided at a later date.\r\n\r\nStep 1 - LAMP Installation and memcached\r\n\r\nIf you do not already have LAMP installed then follow the instructions below. You will also need memcached running on your server. This is currently optional but will become required for planned future features in minoTour.\r\n\r\n`:-$ sudo apt-get update`\r\n\r\n`:-$ sudo apt-get install lamp-server^`\r\n\r\n`:-$ sudo apt-get install memcached php5-memcache`\r\n\r\nNote - you really should set a password for the mySQL root user when prompted to at this point…you will use this later on. Also make sure your local firewalls are configured to allow access for http, https, ssh (for admin) and mySQL and the necessary ports are open on your server.\r\n\r\nStep 2 - Perl Background Processes\r\n\r\nYou need to install the perl memcached module\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install libcache-memcached-perl`\r\n\r\nYou should also install the following perl module (#idiot check - you may need to install make if it isn't already on your system… `sudo apt-get install make` )\r\n\r\n`Parallel-Loops`\r\n\r\nStep 3 - Configure mySQL for minoTour.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ubuntu, you have to use the following steps to enable mySQL to communicate with the outside world:\r\n\r\n\t1\trun the command vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf\r\n\t2\tcomment bind-address = 127.0.0.1 using the # symbol\r\n\t3\trestart your mysql server once.\r\n\r\n`sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
